What is Compendia actually going to be? It's been pretty vague so far. I am toying with
some way to prototype it, whether that's just a fake webpage or something with actual
bells and whistles as time goes on, who knows. But the gist of it is that it's a web 
resource something like, say, Wikipedia, except instead of information on general knowledge
topics, it's a platform full of statistics and data visualizations relating to the
four major league sports: 

* MLB
* NBA
* NFL
* NHL

Now, full disclosure, I've never paid much attention to the first three, and even the
NHL I only got back into around 2015 after a hiatus that had lasted since a year after NHL 
2002 was released and I stopped playing it. That maybe makes me not the best man for this job,
but since I still don't see anyone else making this resource, and I want to use it, I'm 
just going to steamroll ahead. 

All of this said, though, what does it mean to just be a platform full of data and 
statistics? Why not simply go to [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/) 
for that, or any of the leagues' own statistics pages (e.g., the 
[NHL's stats page](https://www.nhl.com/stats/)) instead? Well, there are a few reasons:

1. When I had this idea years ago, those resources weren't as fleshed out as they are now
2. The data is either totally inaccessible and/or proprietary, or else it lacks any kind of
      visualization
3. There is no interactivity, no community, no engagement, etc., and users have little to no
      input into what they're seeing on the dashboard in front of them

To make an analogy again with Wikipedia and information, the current state of data and
statistics resources on the web is a bit like the way it used to be for information. Data
peddlers are out hawking their wares (e.g., proprietary data, interpretations, etc.) like
the door-to-door encyclopedia salesmen of yore. This sort of exclusive access was eliminated
by the likes of Wikipedia and the modern internet. A resource like Compendia is in some
small way aiming to be the first shot in a salvo that does the same for data.

Again, I'm probably not the man for the job, here. I don't really have the skills or the time
left in my life to be breaking that kind of new ground. In any case, sports data is pretty much
all open-source to begin with, so it's not a great example of that grander idea. But I do want 
to engage with sports statistics and the corresponding data visualizations in a way that is 
more fun, more intuitive, and has a community around it, so I'm building this. Here's a 
disgustingly rudimentary prototype of what I mean:

[Very ugly, maybe the link is even broken or times out once my free trial expires](https://preview.uxpin.com/f6604640448bf3ee6a6f28977a55985c36887161)

There's almost no need for a prototype of something this basic at this stage, as it amounts
to essentially: click button, see stats. But I have to start somewhere, and I can at least
point to this so people understand that it's a website where you click buttons to see stats.
But I don't want *just me* to be deciding what stats or visualizations you see when you click
the buttons. I want a community of enthusiasts doing that, something like they are doing
for Wikipedia already.
