Real work seems to take priority quite often, and before you know it a month has gone by. Unfortunately,
I still haven't been able to put much time into this project, but maybe that can change soon. In any
case, for now I'm going to start building the website proper. 

What does that look like? I have a relatively loose understanding of DNS/web hosting/web development and
that whole stack, so it might be a rough go of things to start. As far as I know, the control flow should
look something like this: 

### Domain &harr; Host &harr; Codebase

where the domain, in this case, is [the-compendium.org](https://the-compendium.org), the codebase will
be the actual web development code that I write and store on this GitHub repository, and the host is
presumably just GoDaddy? Since that's where I purchased my domain? 

Well, I think that's right. So, I'll be "developing" the website in the `website` branch of this repo,
and I'll just try to test it out manually in a personal browser as I develop it, since the stand-in I
built in that template editor is currently occupying the domain. My understanding is that when I actually
want the code from the `website` directory/branch to be accessed by the domain, I'll have to start paying
for hosting and then do something with the DNS settings or some file called `CNAME` or something like
that so the files are pointed to properly and the real website goes live. 

I feel like if I had the patience or the time to dedicate myself to this it should just take a few
days, but more likely it'll be a few months. Wish me luck!
