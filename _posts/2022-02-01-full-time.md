It's looking like one day a week isn't going to cut it for this. So far I've
set up a repository and a documentation webpage, explored some old code,
and... that's about it. 

The rest of my time is being eaten up somehow, but I don't quite know how, so 
I'll have to be a bit more intentional about working on projects from here on
out. It's already February. 

First things first, I'll have to add the NHL notebook (and all future notebooks)
to `.gitignore`. I forgot what a mess they are with git. Next, I'm still toying 
with the notebook itself to do more interesting stuff with the season data. E.g.,
this relatively simple goals per game average plot:

It's pretty self-explanatory, and perhaps not all that insightful. But it's fun
to make. Unfortunately, I'm liable to just keep making dinky plots like this
forever instead of actually building a platform for presenting them, exploring
them, creating them, etc., everything else "Compendia" is supposed to be. 

So I'll have to start taking it a bit more seriously. The next step might be
to design some kind of webpage prototype? We'll find out tomorrow, I guess. I
don't expect I'll actually start doing this full time, but I'm aiming for a little
more than once a week.
