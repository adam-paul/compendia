It's looking like one day a week isn't going to cut it for this. So far I've
set up a repository and a documentation webpage, explored some old code,
and... that's about it. 

The rest of my time is being eaten up somehow, but I don't quite know how, so 
I'll have to be a bit more intentional about working on projects from here on
out. It's already February.
