I am trying to rediscover some growth mindset enthusiasm and imagine myself being able to learn
(and re-learn) things like SQL, Apache, and the other presumably necessary skill sets I'll have
to use for this project. 

The real question though is where the hell do I start? This is the "documentation" of the build,
so this isn't the actual place where stats or visualizations or whatever is being offered
would be accessed. So where is? I guess I have to get a domain name? 

But then what am I building first? A website with buttons? A statistics engine? A predictive
algorithm?
