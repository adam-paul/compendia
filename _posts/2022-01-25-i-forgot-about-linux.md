Whoops, I forgot I'd have to destroy my entire Linux partition and reinstall it from scratch
in order to upgrade Python. 

Anyway, it was about time I moved on from Linux Mint. It's a great distribution for beginners,
which arguably I still am, but at this point it just tries a little too hard to be
Windows-like, and I already have a Windows partition, so if I wanted Windows-like I would
probably just use Windows. Ubuntu is really no less beginner-friendly, besides a few tiny
quirks, but such quirks are the things that make it much more straightforward to do things
like... oh, I don't know, just upgrade my goddamn python version without bricking the 
distro. Whoops. 

Anyway, onto ubuntu.
