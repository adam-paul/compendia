A few logistical hurdles have presented themselves, primary among them the difficulty securing
any kind of domain name that included the words *compendia* or *compendium*. The name is not
particularly important to me, but since I've already written it in a bunch of places it's just
easier to stick with it. In the end, I was able to purchase 
[the-compendium.org](https://the-compendium.org) for like 15 bucks a year, and it has a GoDaddy
placeholder site sitting there for the time being. 

Of course, I've also just realized that February is literally the worst month for purchasing
anything on monthly payments or for getting monthly free trials of any kind. Month-long free
trials use *calendar months*, not 30 days. Great. 

So, I've got 2 weeks or so to build out the prototype, a domain name secured, and now pretty
much a blank slate. I'll have to start doing the heavy lifting pretty quick here:

* Actually building a website, linking it to whatever engines or databases I can
  cobble together and then publishing it to the domain.
* Learning (or perhaps re-learning) a bunch of statistics and data visualization techniques.
* Diving into sports statistics and data more seriously.

At least the last one should be fun. Anyway, that means it'll probably be a while before
anything gets published here, but that's fine because I've now made three posts in three
days and that means I was productive the proof is right there no one can say I wasn't just
look right there at all the content you *have* to say I was productive.
